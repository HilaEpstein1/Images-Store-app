Hi,
This is An Authentication based system for uploading and downloading images using AWS services. Based on Ryan Dhungel's Course for building MERN Stack app with AWS for Storage (S3) and Email service(SES) 

Server runs on http://localhost:8000 and client on http://localhost:3000

client side:
npm run dev

Server side:
npm start

Both sides needs downloading dependencies(node modules).
